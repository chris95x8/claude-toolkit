## Executive Summary

[2–4 sentences summarizing the overall state of the documentation. Note the number of issues found, the highest priority tier present, and the single most important thing the team should address before proceeding.]

| P0 — Critical / Blocker | N |
| P1 — High | N |
| P2 — Medium | N |
| P3 — Low | N |
| **Total** | **N** |

## Issues

Issues are listed from highest to lowest priority. Within the same priority tier, issues are ordered by the area of the system they affect.

## Strengths

[Optional but recommended. Note 2–4 things the documentation does well — clear decisions made, good coverage of edge cases, well-structured flows, etc. This makes the audit actionable rather than purely critical.]

---

## Recommended Next Steps

[Ordered list of the most important actions for the team to take, based on the issues above. Frame as concrete tasks, not vague suggestions.]
