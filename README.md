# Claude Toolkit
A collection of agents, prompts, commands, skills, etc. to use with Claude Code and other LLMs.

## Agents
- [spec-specialist](/agents/spec-specialist.md): Feed UI designs and it will help draft engineering specs by systematically uncovering logic, state, and dependencies. It does not look at viusal styling unless it's part of logic. It is collaborative; have a back-and-forth with it by explaining behavior and it will output a concise and prescriptive spec of functionality which can then be used to draft Jira tickets.
