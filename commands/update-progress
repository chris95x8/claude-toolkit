# /update-progress

You are updating the implementation status document at `docs/implementation-status.md`.

## Purpose

This document provides a current-state architecture overview for engineers joining the project. It describes what exists now, not what should be built next.

## Your Task

1. **Analyze the conversation** to identify what was just implemented (components, endpoints, functions, data flows, architecture patterns)
2. **Read `docs/implementation-status.md`** to understand the existing documented architecture
3. **Update the file** by adding new implementation details in the appropriate sections

## Document Structure

Organize content into these main sections:

- **Frontend** - UI components, pages, state management
- **Backend** - Services, business logic, data processing
- **API** - Endpoints, request/response formats, authentication
- **Data Flow** - How components/systems interact (e.g., "X component passes data to Y service, which returns Z")
- **Infrastructure** - Database schema, external services, deployment setup

## Content Guidelines

- **What to include:** Component names, key function names with brief descriptions, data flow patterns, architectural relationships
- **Level of detail:** Enough for an engineer to understand the system's current shape without reading all the code
- **Style:** Clear, factual descriptions. Example: "UserProfile component fetches user data from `/api/users/:id` endpoint, displays it in a card layout, and passes edit actions to UserEditModal component"
- **What to exclude:** TODO items, future plans, chronological history, implementation decisions/rationale

## Update Approach

- Add new information to existing sections rather than creating duplicates
- If a component/feature is mentioned but now has more detail, enhance the existing entry
- Maintain consistent formatting within each section
- If the file doesn't exist, create it with the structure above

After updating, confirm what you added and where in the document.
